This is my final project for graduation. In this project, a facial recognition system was developed for the turnstiles at the university. 
Instant photos are taken through a camera, directed to virtual computers containing Ubuntu via an ftp server, and these computers send signals to the Arduinos integrated into the turnstile via the facial recognition service on the main computer.
